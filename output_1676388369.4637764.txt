The Supreme Court of the United States has overturned the lower court's ruling that Mississipi's Gestational Age Act, which bans abortions after 15 weeks, is unconstitutional. The Court has ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, and that the Act is therefore constitutional.

The Supreme Court revisits the question of whether there is a constitutional right to abortion, one that has been left open since the Casey decision. The Court looks at the various constitutional provisions that have been put forth as potential sources for such a right, but ultimately concludes that there is no explicit or implicit right to abortion in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition, and is therefore not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Court has stated that historical inquiries are essential in determining which rights are protected by the Clause, as the term "liberty" alone provides little guidance. The Court has been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, and in this case has found that the right to abortion does not meet the criteria for protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Solicitor General suggests that the history of abortion supports an abortion right because the common law did not criminalize abortion before quickening. However, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone recognized such a right.

The Supreme Court ruled that the right to an abortion cannot be justified as a component of a broader right, and that the right to an abortion is different because it destroys potential life.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, and that the doctrine of stare decisis does not require continued acceptance of Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The Court has identified five factors that weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey: the nature of the Court's error, the subsequent development of the law, the reliance interests at stake, the workability of the decision, and the legitimacy of the Court's process.

The Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade, short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters, without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent. The Court's reasoning failed to explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the meaning of the Constitution. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court did not have the authority to legislate on this issue.

The Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruled that the "undue burden" test from Casey is unworkable and should be overruled. The "undue burden" test from Casey is a test that has been used to determine whether or not a state regulation of abortion is constitutional. The problem with the test is that it is not clear what qualifies as an "undue burden." The Court in Dobbs held that the "undue burden" test is unworkable because it is too vague and cannot be consistently applied.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the "undue burden test" created by the Casey decision is unworkable and must be overruled. This test had created problems by setting out three subsidiary rules which created their own problems. The Court ruled that the continued adherence to Casey's test would undermine the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to abortion is a constitutional right, but that this right is not absolute and that states may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons. The Court has also ruled that the public perception of the Court's decisions should not be influenced by extraneous factors such as public opinion.

The Constitution allows for laws to be challenged, but courts cannot substitute their own social or economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. This applies even to laws regulating abortion, which are entitled to a presumption of constitutionality.
