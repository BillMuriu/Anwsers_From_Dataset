The Court finds that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nations history and tradition. The underlying theory on which Casey restedthat the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for libertyhas long been controversial. The Courts decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rightsthose rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition and whether it is essential to this Nations scheme of ordered liberty.

The Court has been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, and in this case has found that the right to abortion does not meet the criteria for protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.
