S., at 851. Ordered     4 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing interests. Roe and Casey each struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed potential life. Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Casey, 505 U.

What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe termed potential life and what the law challenged in this case calls an unborn human being. None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question
