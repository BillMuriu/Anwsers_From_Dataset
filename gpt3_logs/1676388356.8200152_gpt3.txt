Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation.

Then, after surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of factfinding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the meaning of the Constitution.

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade, short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters, without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent. The Court's reasoning failed to explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the meaning of the Constitution. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court did not have the authority to legislate on this issue.
